## Smart-Ladle-Tracking-System
### Salient Features:

**Real-Time Tracking** <br>
The system employs computer vision and OCR for real-time tracking, continuously monitoring ladle movements within the steel plant. Computer vision algorithms analyze ladle visuals, while OCR accurately captures ladle numbers. This ensures precise identification, eliminating human errors and enhancing ladle management.

**Server Security with Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Blockchain** <br>
LadleTrackingSystem prioritizes data protection with server security measures, zero-knowledge proofs, and blockchain. Zero-knowledge proofs validate transactions without exposing ladle details, while blockchain ensures a secure, tamper-proof ledger. Hedera Hashgraph and BTFS enhance distributed ledger technology and decentralized data storage.

**Predictive Machine Learning for Equipment Failure Prediction and Process Optimization** <br>
Harnessing predictive machine learning, LadleTrackingSystem identifies equipment failure patterns and optimizes ladle management processes. Using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, the system provides proactive maintenance, process efficiency improvements, and data-driven decision-making.

**AI-Driven Recommendations for Anomaly Detection and Energy Savings** <br>
LadleTrackingSystem utilizes AI-driven recommendations for anomaly detection and energy savings. Machine learning models, including neural networks and statistical analysis, monitor ladle data in real-time. Anomalies trigger alerts, and energy-saving recommendations optimize ladle operations for efficiency and cost savings.

**Resilient in Low Network Connectivity Areas** <br>
Ensuring continuous operation in low network connectivity areas, LadleTrackingSystem employs local data storage, synchronization, and caching. This resilience safeguards ladle tracking data, preserves data integrity, and provides real-time information, even in challenging network environments.
